# How versioning works:

### Example: 24Q3 Summer Update 1.1 | 2.5.1.2.2420
1. 24Q3 = 3rd Quarter (Q3) of 2024
2. Summer Update = Update Name
3. 1.1 = 1st patch (.1) of the Summer Update (1.0)
4. 2.0 = API Version
5. X.5 = Minor Version
6. X.X.1 = Patch Version
7. X.X.X.2 = We use this to indicate how many times we compiled this specific release before it was ready to release :)
8. X.X.X.X.2420 = 24 is the year (2024). 20 is the week number out of the total 52 (and 1 day) weeks in 2024
