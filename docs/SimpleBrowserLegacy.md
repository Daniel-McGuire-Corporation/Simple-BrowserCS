# Simple Browser Legacy

SB Legacy is a portable version of the first in-dev alpha.

## Plans

We will be adding to it and developing Simple Browser as if we were professionals when we started the initial development of SB. We plan on releasing installers once SBLegacy is stable. For now, extract it wherever; it doesn't matter.

### Contributions

Simple Browser Legacy's code is at /src/windows-legacy. Feel free to contribute.
